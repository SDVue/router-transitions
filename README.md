# steps

Add a basic Posts route:

- create a child component & route
- add a router-link element
- router-link to attribute

Add child route:

- user route children
- setup router-view
- difference between base route paths and child route paths

Small improvements to routes:

- router-link exact
- route props

Using vue transitions on routes:

- add transition element
- create transition styles
- cover transition mode

Handling new routes with same component

- Prev/Next link
- Using method, created, and watcher
- Using just method and watcher
- Using router-view key
